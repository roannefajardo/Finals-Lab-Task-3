# [Finals-Lab-Task-3](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19719453/FajardoFLT3.docx)
This portfolio focuses on learning the fundamentals of MySQL by designing and working with a basic product database. It involves straightforward tasks such as creating a table, applying constraints, inserting valid records, and modifying a column. The objective is to gain hands-on experience in structuring and managing a simple SQL-based database.

# Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Create the `products` Table**  
   - Set up a table called `products` with the following columns:  
     - `id`: Auto-incrementing primary key  
     - `product_name`: Text field (up to 100 characters), cannot be null  
     - `price`: Decimal value

2. **Add a Constraint**  
   - Implement a `CHECK` constraint to ensure that the `price` is greater than 0.

3. **Insert Valid Product Records**  
   - Only input products with a positive price:
     - Laptop – 999.99  
     - Smartphone – 599.99  
     - Tablet – 299.99  
     - Keyboard – 19.99  
     - Mouse – 14.99  
     - Desk Lamp – 24.99  
     - Speakers – 9.99  
   - Exclude any items with negative pricing.

4. **Modify the Table**  
   - Update the `product_name` column to allow up to 120 characters instead of the original 100.
